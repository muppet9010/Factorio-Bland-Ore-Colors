# Factorio-Bland-Ore-Colors

Lets you independently control ore colors ingame and in the minimap, including making them invisible!. Also lets you turn off the minimap onhover patch highlighting. Very useful if you are playing a mixed ore map or just find the ore patches too bright, i.e. dangOreus

Can apply the below color profiles to all the ingame ores and separately to all the ore's minimap colors. Currently only supports base game ores.
Uranium ore has no glow on all color profiles other than "vanilla".

When the mod is added or the setting changed the visible map will be re-charted (refreshed) so the new map ore colors are applied.
