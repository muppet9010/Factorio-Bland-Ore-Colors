# Factorio-Bland-Ore-Colors

Lets you make the base game ores blander colour versions. Useful if you are playing a mixed ore map or just find the ore patches too bright, i.e. dangOreus
Colours are based on map color rather than a particular part of the vanilla game's ore image.
Uranium ore has no glow on all color profiles other than "vanilla".

When the mod is added or the setting changed the visible map will be re-charted (refreshed) so the new map ore colors are applied.
