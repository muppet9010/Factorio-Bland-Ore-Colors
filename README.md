# Factorio-Bland-Ore-Colors

Lets you make the base game ores blander colour versions. Useful if you are playing a mixed ore map or just find the ore patches too bright.
Colours are based on map color rather than a particular part of the vanilla game's ore image.
Uranium ore now has no glow.

When the mod is added or the setting changed the visible map will be re-charted (refreshed) so the new map ore colors are applied.
